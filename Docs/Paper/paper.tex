%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
%% The 'procedia' option causes ecrc to approximate to the Word template
\documentclass[3p,times,procedia]{elsarticle}
\flushbottom

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}
%\usepackage{amsmath}


%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Transportation Research Procedia}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{Author name}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.
\jid{aaspro}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
%\jnltitlelogo{Transportation Research Procedia}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using BibTeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

\begin{abstract}
The geography of fuel prices has several implications, from a significant impact on accessibility patterns to issues of territorial equity and transportation governance. In this paper, we study its spatio-temporal patterns at a high resolution. We construct a dataset collecting daily oil prices for two months, on a significant proportion of US gaz facilities, using a specifically-designed large scale data crawling technology. The implementation of a web-application for interactive spatio-temporal data exploration guide further statistical investigations, namely that oil price exhibit patterns that are strongly non-stationary in space and time. The behavior of spatial autocorrelation suggests the use of specific spatial econometric methods to study the role of explanatory variables that are either geographical or temporal. We study the influence of socio-economic variables, by using complementary methods: Geographically Weighted Regression to take into account spatial non-stationarity, and Multi-level modeling to condition both at the state and county level. The former yields an optimal spatial range roughly corresponding to stationarity scale, and significant influence of variables such as population density or median income, but is less accurate around administrative borders. On the other hand, multi-level modeling reveals a strong state fixed effect, and also a non-negligible county effect. Through the combination of such methods, we unveil the superposition of a governance process with a local socio-economical spatial process. Results are furthermore consistent across the different dates. We discuss one important application that is the elaboration of locally parametrized car-regulation policies.

%%  TEMPLATES


%
%Here introduce the paper, and put a nome¬nclature if necessary, in a box with the same font size as the rest of the paper. The paragraphs continue from here and are only separated by headings, subheadings, images and formulae. The section headings are arranged by numbers, bold and 10 pt. Here follows further instructions for authors.
%
%\begin{nomenclature}
%\begin{deflist}[A]
%\defitem{A}\defterm{radius of}
%\defitem{B}\defterm{position of}
%\defitem{C}\defterm{further nomenclature continues down the page inside the text box\vspace*{-8pt}}
%\end{deflist}
%\end{nomenclature}
%\vspace*{0pt}
%
%\subsection{Structure}
%Files must be in LaTeX format only and should be formatted for direct printing, using the CRC LaTeX template provided. Figures and tables should be embedded and not supplied separately. 
%
%Please make sure that you use as much as possible normal fonts in your documents. Special fonts, such as fonts used in the Far East (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.) may cause problems during processing. To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the `spellchecker' function of TeX Editor. Follow this order when typing manuscripts: Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Keywords, Main text (including figures and tables), Acknowledgements, References, Appendix. Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article and do not include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise.
%
%Bulleted lists may be included and should look like this:
%\begin{itemize}[]
%\item First point
%\item Second point
%\item And so on
%\end{itemize}
%
%Ensure that you return to the `Els-body-text' style, the style that you will mainly be using for large blocks of text, when you have completed your bulleted list. 
%
%Please do not alter the formatting and style layouts which have been set up in this template document. As indicated in the template, papers should be prepared in single column format suitable for direct printing onto paper with trim size $192 \times 262$ mm. Do not number pages on the front, as page numbers will be added separately for the preprints and the Proceedings. Leave a line clear between paragraphs. All the required style templates are provided in the file ``LaTeX Template'' with the appropriate name supplied, e.g. choose 1. Els1st-order-head for your first order heading text, els-abstract-text for the abstract text etc.
%
%\subsection{ Tables}
%
%All tables should be numbered with Arabic numerals. Every table should have a caption. Headings should be placed above tables, left justified. Only horizontal lines should be used within a table, to distinguish the column headings from the body of the table, and immediately above and below the table. Tables must be embedded into the text and not supplied separately. Below is an example which the authors may find useful.
%
%\begin{table}[h]
%\caption{An example of a table.}
%\begin{tabular*}{\hsize}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lll@{}}
%\toprule
%An example of a column heading & Column A ({\it{t}}) & Column B ({\it{t}})\\
%\colrule
%And an entry &   1 &  2\\
%And another entry  & 3 &  4\\
%And another entry &  5 &  6\\
%\botrule
%\end{tabular*}
%\end{table}
%
%%\enlargethispage{12pt}
%
%\subsection{ Construction of references}
%
%References must be listed at the end of the paper. Do not begin them on a new page unless this is absolutely necessary. Authors should ensure that every reference in the text appears in the list of references and vice versa. Indicate references by \cite{clark} or \cite{Deal} or \cite{Fachinger2006} in the text. 
%
%Some examples of how your references should be listed are given at the end of this template in the `References' section, which will allow you to assemble your reference list according to the correct format and font size.
%
%Reference generation by using bibliography style commands for LaTeX template only.
%
%The author may use ``elsarticle-harv.bst'' as per the style required in document. The sample bib file could be referred. 
%If the author may using bibstyle for providing references author must comment the bibliography section in TeX file, Bibtex will generate the reference automatically.
%
%If the author may not able to view the references in output same could be done by copying the bibliography section from ``filename.bbl'' file and paste in TeX file.
%
%
%
%\subsection{Section headings}
%Section headings should be left justified, bold, with the first letter capitalized and numbered consecutively, starting with the Introduction. Sub-section headings should be in capital and lower-case italic letters, numbered 1.1, 1.2, etc,~and left justified, with second~and subsequent lines indented. All headings should have a minimum of two text lines after them before a page or column break.
%Ensure the text area is not blank except for the last page.
%
%\subsection{General guidelines for the preparation of your text}
%Avoid hyphenation at the end of a line. Symbols denoting vectors and matrices should be indicated in bold type. Scalar variable names should normally be expressed using italics. Weights and measures should be expressed in SI units. All non-standard abbreviations or symbols must be defined when first mentioned, or a glossary provided.
%
%\subsection{File naming and delivery}
%Please title your files in this order `procedia acronym\_conference acronym\_authorslastname'.  Submit both the source file and the PDF to the Guest Editor.
%
%Artwork filenames should comply with the syntax ``aabbbbbb.ccc'', where:\vspace*{-12pt}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item a = artwork component type
%\item b = manuscript reference code
%\item c = standard file extension
%
%Component types:
%\item gr = figure
%\item pl = plate
%\item sc = scheme
%\item fx = fixed graphic
%\end{itemize}



%
%
%
%\subsection{Footnotes}
%Footnotes should be avoided if possible. Necessary footnotes should be denoted in the text by consecutive superscript letters\footnote{Footnote text.}. The footnotes should be typed single spaced, and in smaller type size (8 pt), at the foot of the page in which they are mentioned, and separated from the main text by a one line space extending at the foot of the column. The `Els-footnote' style is available in the ``TeX Template'' for the text of the footnote.
%
%Please do not change the margins of the template as this can result in the footnote falling outside printing range.
%
%
%\section{Illustrations}
%All figures should be numbered with Arabic numerals (1,2,3,\,$\ldots.$). Every figure should have a caption. All\break photographs, schemas, graphs and diagrams are to be referred to as figures. Line drawings should be good quality\break scans or true electronic output. Low-quality scans are not acceptable. Figures must be embedded into the text and not supplied separately. In MS word input the figures must be properly coded. Preferred format of figures are PNG, JPEG, GIF etc. Lettering and symbols should be clearly defined either in the caption or in a legend provided as part of the figure. Figures should be placed at the top or bottom of a page wherever possible, as close as possible to the first reference to them in the paper. Please ensure that all the figures are of 300 DPI resolutions as this will facilitate good output.
%\begin{figure}[t]\vspace*{4pt}
%%\centerline{\includegraphics{fx1}\hspace*{5mm}\includegraphics{fx1}}
%\centerline{\includegraphics{gr1}}
%\caption{(a) first picture; (b) second picture.}
%\end{figure}
%
%The figure number and caption should be typed below the illustration in 8 pt and left justified [{{\bfseries\itshape Note:}} one-line captions of length less than column width (or full typesetting width or oblong) centered]. For more guidelines and information to help you submit high quality artwork please visit: http://www.elsevier.com/artworkinstructions\break Artwork has no text along the side of it in the main body of the text. However, if two images fit next to each other, these may be placed next to each other to save space. For example, see Fig.~1. 
%
%
%\section{Equations}
%Equations and formulae should be typed in Mathtype, and numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in parentheses on the right hand side of the page (if referred to explicitly in the text). They should also be separated from the surrounding text by one space
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{array}{lcl}
%\displaystyle X_r &=& \displaystyle\dot{Q}^{''}_{rad}\left/\left(\dot{Q}^{''}_{rad} + \dot{Q}^{''}_{conv}\right)\right.\\[6pt]
%\displaystyle \rho &=& \displaystyle\frac{\vec{E}}{J_c(T={\rm const.})\cdot\left(P\cdot\left(\displaystyle\frac{\vec{E}}{E_c}\right)^m+(1-P)\right)}
%\end{array}
%\end{equation}
%
